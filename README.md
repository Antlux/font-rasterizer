# Font Rasterizer
Font Rasterizer is a tool made with the purpose of generating font atlas textures.

## Examples & Usage
Here are a few examples of atlases made using font rasterizer:

![PixelCode-Medium-(w14-h16)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f2ce19f-0b2f-4e59-827c-99e190b083eb)

And here is an example of what you can do with those textures:

## Using the tool & Requirements
To be able to use Font Rasterizer you need to have a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed on your machine. 

### Running the project
First you need to clone the repository as there is no release as of yet.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Antlux/font-rasterizer.git
```
Then running the project is as simple running "cargo run" in the project folder.
```bash
  cd font-rasterizer
```
```bash
  cargo run
```

## Useful resources & Inspiration
The whole reason I was inspired to develop this tool was Acerola's [font art video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg40RWiaHRY&t=719s), I wanted to recreate the effect shown in his video but could not find any adequate font texture atlas so I decided to make my own.

- [Unifont](http://czyborra.com/unifont/updates/unifont.ttf)
